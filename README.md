# CSC.130-Team-Pyroxene

This is a student registration project completed by Kristen, Luke, and Shelby for Computing Fundamentals II at Wake Technical Community College. This was the final project for the semester, but may not be completely up to date.

<!---
The functions are as follows:
- Student class to store the information for each student (Luke's task)
- Add a course function. Each individual student's courses would be stored in a set since they won't be taking multiple of the same class. (Shelby's task)
- Add to a waitlist function. This would use a queue. (Kristen's task)
- Remove a course/drop all classes function. (Shelby's task)
- List the classes a person is taking. (Luke's task)
- Have a way of paying for the classes. This might pull information from a dictionary for general class information where the class is the key and the value is the price. (Luke's task)
- The registration file where the menu will be looped through. (Shelby's task)
