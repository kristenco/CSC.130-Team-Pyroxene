# CSC.130-Team-Pyroxene

Hi team! Once you see this, make sure you just submit your own portion of your code and everything can be combined.

The functions will be in a separate file than the menu and just be imported.

Our current tasks are as follows:
- Student class to store the information for each student
- Add a course function. Each individual student's courses would be stored in a set since they won't be taking multiple of the same class.
- Add to a waitlist function. This would use a queue.
- Remove a course/drop all classes function.
- List the classes a person is taking. (Luke's task)
- Have a way of paying for the classes. This might pull information from a dictionary for general class information where the class is the key and the value is the price. (Luke's task)
- The registration file where the menu will be looped through. (Shelby's task)
